EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT DISPUTE
CASE FILE: Smith v. TechCorp Industries

BACKGROUND:
John Smith was employed as Senior Software Engineer at TechCorp Industries from January 2020 to March 2024. His employment contract contained a non-compete clause preventing him from working for competitors for 18 months post-termination.

FACTS:
1. Smith's employment contract dated January 15, 2020, included:
   - Salary: $120,000 annually
   - Non-compete period: 18 months
   - Confidentiality obligations
   - Intellectual property assignment clause

2. On February 1, 2024, Smith received written warning for "inadequate performance" despite receiving "exceeds expectations" ratings in previous reviews.

3. March 10, 2024: Smith was terminated for "poor performance and violation of company policies."

4. March 15, 2024: Smith immediately joined competitor StartupTech as Lead Engineer with $150,000 salary.

5. TechCorp claims Smith:
   - Violated non-compete agreement
   - Took proprietary source code
   - Solicited TechCorp clients for StartupTech

WITNESS STATEMENTS:

Sarah Johnson (HR Director): "Smith's performance declined significantly in late 2023. We documented multiple instances of missed deadlines and poor code quality. The termination was performance-based, not retaliatory."

Mike Chen (Former Colleague): "John was one of our best engineers. His 'performance issues' only started after he questioned the new overtime policies in December 2023. The company wanted him gone."

Lisa Rodriguez (Project Manager): "Smith had access to our core algorithms and client database. On his last day, I saw him copying files to a USB drive. When I asked, he said it was 'personal projects.'"

LEGAL ISSUES:
1. Enforceability of non-compete clause in California
2. Wrongful termination claim
3. Trade secret misappropriation allegations
4. Retaliatory discharge

EVIDENCE:
- Employment contract with non-compete clause
- Performance reviews (2020-2023: all positive, 2024: negative)
- Email warnings about performance
- Computer access logs showing file transfers
- StartupTech job offer dated March 12, 2024 (before termination)

SMITH'S POSITION:
- Termination was retaliatory for questioning overtime policies
- Non-compete is unenforceable under California law
- No trade secrets were taken - only personal code snippets
- Performance decline was due to hostile work environment

TECHCORP'S POSITION:
- Legitimate performance-based termination
- Smith violated non-compete and confidentiality obligations
- Proprietary algorithms were stolen
- Client solicitation caused business harm

RELEVANT STATUTES:

- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
