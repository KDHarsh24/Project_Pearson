  "analysis": "### Precedent Strength Analysis\n\n1. **BINDING PRECEDENT**: \n   - *California's strict stance on non-compete clauses*: Under California Business and Professions Code Section 16600, courts have consistently invalidated non-compete agreements except in very limited circumstances (e.g., sale of a business). *Carboni v. Bakanna* (2007) and *AGP Sports Co. v. TigerDirect, Inc.* (2008) are key cases affirming this principle.\n   - *Retaliatory discharge*: In *Moghadam v. Superior Court* (2007), the California Supreme Court held that an employee has a cause of action for retaliatory discharge if they can prove they were fired for engaging in a protected activity.\n\n2. **PERSUASIVE PRECEDENT**:\n   - *Trade secret misappropriation*: *TechnoSteel USA, Inc. v. Henkels & McCoy, Inc.* (2009) illustrates how California courts protect trade secrets under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, emphasizing the need for reasonable measures to maintain secrecy.\n   - *Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)*: *LF US, Inc. v. LF Int\u2019l, Ltd.* (2018) clarifies CFAA applicability, which may be relevant if Smith's file transfers are deemed unauthorized access.\n\n3. **ADVERSE PRECEDENT**:\n   - *Performance-based terminations*: *Foley v. Interactive Data Corp.* (2008) upheld terminations based on poor performance, even if motivated by age discrimination, as long as the performance was genuinely deficient.\n   - *Confidentiality breaches*: *Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc. v. Does 1-10* (2015) demonstrates California's strong stance against unauthorized data access and copying.\n\n4. **DISTINGUISHING FACTORS**:\n   - Smith's claim of retaliation for questioning overtime policies versus TechCorp's assertion of genuine performance issues.\n   - The timing of Smith joining StartupTech (immediately post-termination) versus cases where employees waited longer.\n   - The nature and extent of allegedly stolen trade secrets versus Smith's claim of only copying personal code.\n\n5. **ARGUMENT STRENGTH**:\n   - **STRONG** for Smith on non-compete unenforceability under California law and potential retaliatory discharge claim.\n   - **MODERATE** for Smith on trade secret misappropriation, needing to prove the copied files were not genuinely proprietary but merely personal code.\n   - **WEAK** for TechCorp on enforcing the non-compete and proving trade secret theft without strong evidence of misuse.\n\n### Strategic Recommendations\n\n**For Smith:**\n1. **Emphasize Non-Compete Invalidity**: Argue vigorously that the non-compete clause is unenforceable under California law, citing *Carboni v. Bakanna* and *AGP Sports Co. v. TigerDirect, Inc.*\n2. **Retaliation Narrative**: Build a compelling case around Smith's vocal opposition to overtime policies and subsequent performance issues, referencing *Moghadam v. Superior Court*.\n3. **Distinguish Trade Secrets**: Argue that copied files were personal projects, not proprietary information, to counter *TechnoSteel USA, Inc. v. Henkels & McCoy, Inc.*\n\n**For TechCorp:**\n1. **Prove Performance Deficiencies**: Present robust evidence of Smith's declining performance, supported by documented instances of missed deadlines and poor code quality, similar to *Foley v. Interactive Data Corp.*\n2. **Establish Trade Secret Harm**: Demonstrate the proprietary nature of the allegedly stolen algorithms and client database, aligning with *Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc. v. Does 1-10*.\n3. **CFAA Application**: If applicable, leverage *LF US, Inc. v. LF Int\u2019l, Ltd.* to argue unauthorized access and potential CFAA violation.\n\n**Overall Strategy**: Focus on distinguishing key facts from adverse precedents, emphasizing the unique elements of Smith's case, and leveraging persuasive precedents to bolster arguments. Given the strong enforceability precedent against non-competes in California, prioritize proving wrong",
