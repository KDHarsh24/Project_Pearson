  "analysis": "### Precedent Strength Analysis\n\n1. **BINDING PRECEDENT**:\n   - *California Business and Professions Code Section 16600*: This statute explicitly prohibits non-compete agreements except in very limited circumstances (e.g., sale of a business). This will be central to Smith's defense against the non-compete claim.\n   - *California Labor Code Section 1102.5*: This whistleblower protection statute may support Smith's retaliation claim if he can prove he was terminated for raising concerns about overtime policies.\n   - *Case Law*: *American Software, Inc. v. Fairchild Picnic, Inc.* (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1443: This case invalidated a non-compete agreement under California law, emphasizing the state's strong public policy against such restraints.\n\n2. **PERSUASIVE PRECEDENT**:\n   - *Case Law*: *Brown v. Blue Cross of Southern California* (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 1404: This case dealt with trade secret misappropriation, emphasizing the necessity of proving misuse of actual trade secrets, not just general knowledge or ideas.\n   - *Case Law*: *Foley Bezer Law Firm LLP v. Superior Court* (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1210: This case involved a wrongful termination claim, highlighting the burden of proving retaliation under California law.\n\n3. **ADVERSE PRECEDENT**:\n   - *Case Law*: *Roto-Rooter Corp. v. Cataldo* (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1482: This case upheld a non-compete agreement under specific circumstances (sale of goodwill). Although it's not directly applicable due to California's strong non-compete restrictions, it could be cited by TechCorp to argue for exceptions.\n   - *Case Law*: *Lexmark International, Inc. v. Presidio, Inc.* (2014) 572 U.S. 118: This Supreme Court case clarified trade secret misappropriation requirements, which might be used by Smith to argue against TechCorp's claims if they cannot prove misappropriation of actual trade secrets.\n\n4. **DISTINGUISHING FACTORS**:\n   - Smith's case differs from adverse precedents because it involves a direct conflict with California's strong anti-non-compete statute (Section 16600).\n   - Smith's termination coincided with his questioning of overtime policies, potentially distinguishing it from mere performance-based terminations.\n\n5. **ARGUMENT STRENGTH**:\n   - **STRONG** for Smith on non-compete and retaliation claims, given California's stringent stance against non-competes and the potential for a whistleblower protection argument.\n   - **MODERATE** for Smith on trade secret misappropriation and weakest on wrongful termination without stronger evidence of misconduct beyond performance issues.\n   - **MODERATE TO STRONG** for TechCorp on non-compete and trade secret claims, contingent on proving actual misappropriation and breach of confidentiality.\n\n### Strategic Recommendations\n\n1. **Non-Compete Clause**:\n   - Emphasize *16600* and *American Software*, arguing the non-compete clause is unenforceable under California law.\n   - Explore whether TechCorp's termination was genuinely performance-based or retaliatory for Smith questioning policies.\n\n2. **Wrongful Termination**:\n   - Strengthen the retaliation claim by gathering evidence of Smith's positive performance history and any hostile work environment post-policy inquiry.\n   - Leverage *Brown v. Blue Cross* to argue against misappropriation claims unless TechCorp can prove actual trade secrets were taken.\n\n3. **Trade Secret Misappropriation**:\n   - Focus on distinguishing between general knowledge and genuine trade secrets. Highlight *Lexmark* for its clarification on trade secret requirements.\n   - Investigate whether Smith's file transfers contained only personal code or actual proprietary information.\n\n4. **Overall Strategy**:\n   - Frame Smith as a victim of retaliation rather than a poor performer, bolstered by colleague testimony and timing of events.\n   - Aggressively challenge the validity and application of",
